      This document defines new Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP) Data Items that are used to
      support credit-based flow control.
      Credit
      window control is used to regulate when data may be sent to an
      associated virtual or physical queue.  The Data Items are defined in
      an extensible and reusable fashion. Their use will be mandated in
      other documents defining specific DLEP extensions.

      <t>
      The Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP) is defined in <xref target="RFC8175" format="default"/>.  It provides the exchange of link related
      control information between DLEP peers.  DLEP peers are comprised
      of a modem and a router.  DLEP defines a base set of mechanisms as
      well as support for possible extensions.  DLEP defines Data Items
      which are sets of information that can be reused in DLEP
      messaging.
      The base DLEP specification does not include any flow
      identification beyond DLEP endpoints nor flow control capability.
      There are various flow control techniques theoretically possible
      with DLEP.  For example, a credit-window scheme for
      destination-specific flow control which provides aggregate flow
      control for both modem and routers has been proposed in <xref target="I-D.ietf-manet-credit-window" format="default"/>, and a control plane pause
      based mechanism is defined in <xref target="RFC8651" format="default"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
      This document defines DLEP Data Items and Messages which provide
      a flow control mechanism for traffic sent
      from a router to a modem. Flow control is provided using one or
      more logical "Credit Windows", each of which will typically be
      supported by an associated virtual or physical queue.
      A router will use traffic flow classification information
      provided by the modem,
      as defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-traffic-classification" format="default"/>,
      to identify which traffic is associated with
      each credit window.
      In this case, a flow is identified based on
      information found in a data plane header and one or more matches
      are associated with a single flow.  (For general background on
      traffic classification see <xref target="RFC2475" format="default"/> Section 2.3.)
      Credit windows may be shared or dedicated on a per flow basis. The
      Data Items are structured to allow for reuse of the defined
      credit window based flow
      control with different traffic classification techniques.
      A router logically consumes credits for each credit window
      matching packet sent.
      </t>
      <t>
      Note that this document defines common Messages, Data Items and
      mechanisms that are reusable.  They are expected to be required by
      DLEP extensions defined in other documents such as found in <xref target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-da-credit-extension" format="default"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
      This document
      supports credit window control by introducing two new DLEP
      messages in <xref target="sec-msgs" format="default"/>, and five new DLEP Data
      Items in <xref target="sec-data-items" format="default"/>.

      <name>Credit Window Control</name>
      <t>
    This section defines additions to DLEP used in credit based flow
    control.  Two
    new messages and five Data Items are defined to support credit
    window control.  The use of credit window control impacts the data
    plane.
      </t>
      <t>
    The credit window control mechanisms defined in this document
    support credit based flow control of traffic sent from a router to a
    modem.  The mapping of specific flows of traffic to a particular
    credit window is based on the Traffic Classification Data Item
    defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-traffic-classification" format="default"/>. Both types of
    DLEP endpoints, 
    i.e., a router and a modem, negotiate the use of this extension during
    session initialization, e.g., see <xref target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-da-credit-extension" format="default"/>.  When using
    credit windows, data traffic is only allowed to be sent by the
            router to the modem when there are credits available except during
            transients when the credit window has been reduced. Implementations should 
            allow exceeding the credit window during the short time that a router might 
            take to respect the new credit window. 
      </t>
      <t>
    Credits are managed on a per logical "Credit Window" basis.  Each
    credit window can be thought of as corresponding to a queue within a
    modem.  Credit windows may be shared across, or dedicated to,
    destinations and data plane identifiers, e.g., DSCPs, at a
    granularity that is appropriate for a modem's implementation and its
    attached transmission technology.  As defined below, there is a
    direct one-for-one mapping of credit windows to flows as identified
    by Flow Identifiers (FIDs) carried within the Traffic Classification Data Item.  Modems
    pass to the router information on their credit windows and FIDs
    prior to a router being able to send data when an extension
    requiring the use of credit window control is used.  In addition to
    the traffic classification information associated with an FID,
    modems provide an initial credit window size, as well as the
    maximum size of the logical queue associated with each credit
    window.  The maximum size is included for informative and potential
    future uses.
      </t>
      <t>
    Modems provide an initial credit window size at the time of "Credit
    Window Initialization".  Such initialization can take place during
    session initiation or any point thereafter.  It can also take place
    when rate information changes.  Additional "Credit Grants", i.e.,
    increments to Credit Window size, are provided using a Destination
    Up or the new "Credit Control" Message.  A router provides its view
    of the Credit Window, which is known as "Status", in Destination Up
    Response and the new "Credit Control Response" Messages.  Routers
    can also request credits using the new "Credit Control" Message.
      </t>
      <t>
    When modems provide credits to a router, they will need to take into
    account any overhead of their attached transmission technology and
    map it into the credit semantics defined in this document.  In
    particular, the credit window is defined below to include per frame
    (packet) MAC headers, and this may not match the actual overhead of
    the modem attached transmission technology.  In that case a direct
    mapping, or an approximation will need to be made by the modem to
    provide appropriate credit values.
      </t>
      <t>
    Actual flows of traffic are mapped to credit windows based on flow
    identification information provided by modems in the Traffic
    Classification Data item defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-traffic-classification" format="default"/>. This
    data item supports traffic classification on a per destination or
    more fine grain level.  Routers use the combination of the DLEP
    identified destination and flow information associated with a credit
    window in order to match traffic they send to specific credit
    windows.
      </t>
      <t>
    When a destination becomes reachable, a modem "associates"
    (identifies) the appropriate traffic classification information via
    the Traffic Class Identifier (TID) to be used for traffic sent by the router to that
    destination.
    This is supported by the Credit Window
    Association Data Item which is carried in Destination Up and Update
    messages, see <xref target="sec-di-cwa" format="default"/>.
    The TID provides the information to support router traffic
    classification, based on the FIDs contained in the TID, see <xref target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-traffic-classification" format="default"/>. 
    As defined,
    each credit window has a corresponding FID, so traffic is
    mapped to a credit window by locating a matching FID that is
    contained in the TID that is associated with the traffic's
    destination.
    This means that the use of FIDs, TIDs and the association of a
    TID to a DLEP destination enables a modem to share or dedicate
    resources as needed to match the specifics of its implementation and
    its attached transmission technology.
      </t>
      <t>
      The defined credit window control has similar objectives as the
      control found in <xref target="I-D.ietf-manet-credit-window" format="default"/>.
      One notable difference from that credit control is that in this
      document, credits are never provided by the router to the modem.
      </t>

        <name>Data Plane Considerations</name>
        <t>
      When credit windowing is used, a router MUST NOT send data traffic
      to a modem for forwarding when there are no credits available in the
      associated Credit Window.  This document defines credit windows in
      octets.  A credit window value MUST be larger than the number of
      octets contained in a packet, including any MAC overhead (e.g.,
      framing, headers and trailers) used between
      the router and the modem, in order for the router to send the packet
      to a modem for forwarding.  The credit window is decremented by the
      number of sent octets.
        </t>
        <t>
      A router MUST identify the credit window associated with traffic
      sent to a modem based on the traffic classification information
      provided in the Data Items defined in this document.

      </section>
      <section anchor="sec-msgs" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Credit Window Messages</name>
        <t>
      Two new messages are defined in support for credit window control:
      the Credit Control and the Credit Control Response Message.  Sending
      and receiving both message types is REQUIRED to support the credit
      window control defined in this document.
        </t>
        <section anchor="sec-cc-msg" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Credit Control Message</name>
          <t>
        Credit Control Messages are sent by modems and routers. Each
        sender is only permitted to have one message outstanding at one
        time.  That is, a sender (i.e., modem or router) MUST NOT send a
        second or any subsequent Credit Control Message until a Credit
        Control Response Message is received from its peer (i.e., router
        or modem).
          </t>
          <t>
        Credit Control Messages are sent by modems to provide credit
        window increases.  Modems send credit increases when there is
        transmission or local queue availability that exceeds the credit
        window value previously provided to the router. Modems will need to
        balance the load generated by sending and processing frequent credit
        window increases against a router having data traffic available to send,
        but no credits available.
          </t>
          <t>
        Credit Control Messages MAY be sent by routers to request
        credits and provide window status. Routers will need to
        balance the load generated by sending and processing frequent credit
        window requests against having data traffic available to send,
        but no credits available.

        A message sent by a modem, MUST contain one or more
        Credit Window Grant Data Items as defined below in <xref target="sec-di-grant" format="default"/>.  A router receiving this message MUST
        respond with a Credit Control Response Message.
          </t>
          <t>
        A message sent by a router, MUST contain one or more Credit Window
        Request Data Items defined below in <xref target="sec-di-request" format="default"/> and SHOULD contain a Credit Window
        Status Data Item, defined in <xref target="sec-di-status" format="default"/>,
        corresponding to each credit window request. A modem receiving
        this message MUST respond with a Credit Control Response
        Message based on the received message and Data Item and the
        processing defined below, which will typically result in credit
        window increments being provided.
          </t>

        Credit Control Response Messages are sent by routers to report
        the current Credit Window for a destination.  A message sent by
        a router, MUST contain one or more Credit Window Status Data
        Items as defined below in <xref target="sec-di-status" format="default"/>.

        Credit Window Request Data Item contained in the corresponding
        Credit Control Message received by the modem MUST be
        included.  Each Credit Grant Data Item MAY provide zero or more
        additional credits based on the modem's transmission or local
        queue availability.  Specific receive processing associated with

      Five new Data Items are defined to support credit window control.
      The Credit Window Initialization
      Data Item is used by a modem to identify a credit window and set its
      size.
      The Credit Window Association
      Data Item is used by a modem to identify which traffic classification
      identifiers (flows) should be used when sending traffic to a particular DLEP
      identified destination.
      The Credit Window Grant is used by a modem to provide additional
      credits to a router.
      The Credit Window Request is used by a router to request additional
      credits.
      The Credit Window Status is used to advertise the sender's view of
      number of available credits for state synchronization purposes.
        </t>
        <t>
      Any errors or inconsistencies encountered in parsing Data Items
      are handled in the same fashion as any other data item parsing error
      encountered in DLEP, see <xref target="RFC8175" format="default"/>. In particular, the
      node parsing the Data Item MUST terminate the session with a
      Status Data Item indicating Invalid Data.

        <section anchor="sec-di-cwi" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Credit Window Initialization</name>
          <t>
        The Credit Window Initialization Data Item is used by a modem to
        identify a credit window and set its size.
        In order to avoid errors caused by use of undefined FIDs or
        uninitialized credit windows,
        this Data Item
        SHOULD be included in any Session Initialization Response
        Message that also indicates support for an extension that
        requires support for the credit window control mechanisms
        defined in this document, e.g., see <xref target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-da-credit-extension" format="default"/>.  Updates to
        previously identified credit windows or new credit windows MAY
        be sent by a modem by including the Data Item in Session Update
        Messages.  More than one data item MAY be included in a message
        to provide information on multiple credit windows.
          </t>
          <t>
        The Credit Window Initialization Data Item identifies a credit
        window using a Flow Identifier, or FID.  It also provides the
        size of the identified credit window.  Finally, a queue size (in
        bytes) is provided for informational purposes.  Note that to be
        used, a FID must be defined within a Traffic Classification Data
        Item and the associated TID must be provided via a Credit Window
        Association Data Item.

        A router that receives a Credit Window Initialization Data Item
        MUST ensure that the FID field value has been provided by the
        modem in a Traffic Classification Data Item carried in either
        the current or a previous message.  If the FID cannot be found the
        router SHOULD report or log this information.  Note that
        no traffic will be associated with the credit window in this
        case.  After FID validation, the router MUST locate the credit
        window that is associated with the FID indicated in each
        received Data Item.  If no associated credit window is found,
        the router MUST initialize a new credit window using the values
        carried in the Data Item.  When an associated credit window is
        found, the router MUST update the credit window and associated
        data plane state using the values carried in the Data Item.
        If the resulting Credit Value results in the credit window
        exceeding the represented Credit Window Max Size, the Credit
        Window Max Size field value is used as the new credit window size.
        It
        is worth noting, that such updates can result in a credit window
        size being reduced, for example, due to a transmission rate
        change on the modem.

        It is important to note that while this Data Item can be received in a

        No response is sent by the router to a modem after processing a Credit

        In other cases, the receiving router MUST send a
        Credit Window Status Data Item or items reflecting the
        resulting Credit Window value of the updated credit window.  When the
        Credit Grant Data Item is received in a Destination Up Message, the
        Credit Window Status Data Item(s) MUST be sent in the

        As discussed above, the Destination Up Response Message is used when

        the Credit Control Response Message is sent in response to a Credit
        Control Message.  Multiple Credit Window Status Data Items in a

      Modems MAY support the configuration of the number of credit

        <t>
      Routers may have limits on the number of queues that they can
      support and, perhaps, even limits in supported credit window
      combinations, e.g., if per destination queues can even be
      supported at all.  When modem-provided credit window information
      exceeds the capabilities of a router, the router SHOULD use a subset of
      the provided credit windows.  Alternatively, a router MAY reset the
      session and indicate that the extension is not supported.  In either
      case, the mismatch of capabilities SHOULD be reported to the user via
      normal network management mechanisms, e.g., user interface or error
      logging.
        </t>
        <t>
      In all cases, if credit windows are in use, traffic for which credits are not

              <t>When routing devices rely on modems to effect communications over wireless links, they need timely and accurate knowledge of the characteristics of the link (speed, state, etc.) in order to make routing decisions. In mobile or other environments where these characteristics change frequently, manual configurations or the inference of state through routing or transport protocols does not allow the router to make the best decisions. This document introduces a new protocol called the Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP), which provides a bidirectional, event-driven communication channel between the router and the modem to facilitate communication of changing link characteristics.</t>

Traffic classification information is used to identify traffic flows based on frame/packet content such as destination address. The Data Item is defined in an extensible and reusable fashion.

This document also introduces DLEP Sub-Data Items, and Sub-Data Items are defined to support DiffServ and Ethernet traffic classification.</t>
