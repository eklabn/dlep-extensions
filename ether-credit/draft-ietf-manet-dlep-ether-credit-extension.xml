        This document defines an extension to the Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP) that
        enables an Ethernet IEEE 802.1Q aware credit-window scheme for
        destination-specific and shared flow control.

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>
        The Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP) is defined in <xref target="RFC8175" format="default"/>.  This protocol provides the exchange of link related
        control information between DLEP peers.  DLEP peers 
        consist of a modem and a router.  DLEP defines a base set of
        mechanisms as well as support for possible extensions.  This
        document defines one such extension.
      </t>
      <t>
        The DLEP specification does not include any flow control
        capability.  There are various flow control techniques
        theoretically possible with DLEP.
        This document defines a DLEP extension which provides an Ethernet-based flow
        control mechanism for traffic sent from a router to a
        modem. Flow control is provided using one or more logical
        "Credit Windows", each of which will typically be supported by
        an associated virtual or physical queue.  A
        router will use traffic flow classification information provided
        by the modem to identify which traffic is associated with each
        credit window.
        Credit windows may be shared or dedicated on a per flow
        basis.
        See <xref target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-da-credit-extension"/> for a
        DiffServ-based version of credit window flow control.
	As specified in Section 2.3.1 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-traffic-classification"/>,
  	when both DiffServ and Ethernet traffic classification are specified
  	for a flow, the Ethertype information takes precedence.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document uses the traffic classification and credit window
        control mechanisms defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-traffic-classification"/>
	and <xref target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-credit-flow-control"/> to provide credit
        window based flow control based on DLEP destinations and
        Ethernet VLANs and Priority Code Points.  Ethernet Priority Code
        Point support is defined as part of the IEEE 802.1Q <xref target="IEEE8021Q"/> tag format and includes a 3-bit
        "PCP" field.  The tag format also includes a 12-bit VLAN
        identifier (VID) field.  The defined mechanism allows for credit
        windows to be shared across traffic sent to multiple DLEP
        destinations, Virtual Area Netwokrs (VLANs), and 
	Priority Code Points (PCPs), or used exclusively for traffic
        sent to a particular destination and/or VLAN and/or PCP.  The
        extension also supports the "wildcard" matching of any PCP or
        VID.
      </t>
      <t>
        The extension defined in this document is referred to as "IEEE
        802.1Q Aware Credit Window" or, more simply, the "Ethernet
        Credit" extension. The reader should be familiar with both the
        traffic classification and credit window control mechanisms
        defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-traffic-classification"/>
	and <xref target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-credit-flow-control"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document defines a new DLEP Extension Type Value in <xref target="sec-ext-type"/> which is used to indicate support for
        the extension.

        Extensions Supported Data Item is sent and processed according
        to <xref target="RFC8175" format="default"/>.  Any implementation that indicates
        use of the IEEE 802.1Q Aware Credit Window Extension MUST
        support all Messages, Data Items, the Ethernet Traffic
        Classification Sub-Data Item, and all related processing defined

      <name>Management Considerations</name>
      <t>
        This section provides several network management guidelines to
        implementations supporting the IEEE 802.1Q Aware Credit Window
        Extension.
      </t>
      <t>
        If this extension is supported, that support MUST be declared using
 	the Extensions Supported Data Item (see Section 13.6 of [RFC8175])
	which is configurable on both modens and routers.
 	DiffServ Aware Credit Window Extension Data Items MUST NOT be emitted
 	by a DLEP participant unless such support was specified in the
 	initialization message received from its peer.
	The use of the extension defined in this document SHOULD be
        configurable on both modems and routers.
      </t>
      <t>
        Modems SHOULD support the configuration of PCP to credit window
        (queue) mapping.
      </t>
      <t>
        Modems MAY support the configuration of PCP to credit window
        (queue) mapping on a per VLAN basis. VID value zero
        (0) is used by <xref target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-traffic-classification"/> to indicate that
        VID is ignored and any VID value is used in traffic
        classification.
      </t>
      <t>
        When VLANs are supported by a modem without support from PCPs,
	the modem SHOULD support the configuration of VLAN to credit window
        (queue) mapping.
      </t>
      <t>
        Modems MAY support the configuration of the number of credit
        windows (queues) to advertise to a router.
      </t>
      <t>
        Routers may have limits on the number of queues that they can support
        and limits on supported credit window combinations. Per destination
        queues might not be supported at all.  When modem-provided credit window information
        exceeds the capabilities of a router, the router SHOULD use a
        subset of the provided credit windows.  Alternatively, a router
        MAY reset the session and indicate that the extension is not
        supported.  In either case, the mismatch of
        capabilities SHOULD be reported to the user via normal network
        management mechanisms such as user interface messages or error logging.
      </t>
      <t>
        In all cases, if credit windows are in use, traffic for which
        credits are not available MUST NOT be sent to the modem by the
        router.

      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>
        This document defines a DLEP extension that uses DLEP
        mechanisms and the credit window control and flow mechanisms
        defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-traffic-classification" format="default"/> and <xref target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-credit-flow-control" format="default"/>.
        The defined extension is exposed to vulnerabilities similar to existing
        DLEP messages and discussed in the Security Considerations section
        of <xref target="RFC8175"/> such as an injected message
	resizing a credit window to a value that results in a
	denial of service.
	Wildcards for matching PCP and VID fields are provided which
	may be convenient to match a
        number of packet flows but could inadvertently match unexpected flows or
        new flows that appear after the wildcard matching has been set up. It is
        therefore RECOMMENDED that wildcards not be used unless clearly
        needed.
        The security mechanisms documented in <xref target="RFC8175"
        format="default"/> can be applied equally to the mechanism defined in this document.

        The document was motivated by discussions in the MANET working

        We had the honor of working too briefly with David Wiggins on
        this and related DLEP work. His contribution to the IETF and
        publication of the first and definitive open source DLEP
        implementation have been critical to the acceptance of DLEP. We
        mourn his passing on November 23, 2023.  We wish to recognize his
        guidance, leadership and professional excellence.  We were
        fortunate to benefit from his leadership and friendship. He
        shall be missed.
