        This document defines an extension to the Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP) that

        destination-specific and shared flow control.

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>
        The Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP) is defined in <xref target="RFC8175" format="default"/>.  It provides the exchange of link related
        control information between DLEP peers.  DLEP peers are
        comprised of a modem and a router.  DLEP defines a base set of
        mechanisms as well as support for possible extensions.  This
        document defines one such extension.
      </t>
      <t>
        The base DLEP specification does not include any flow control
        capability.  There are various flow control techniques
        theoretically possible with DLEP.
        This document defines a DLEP extension which provides an Ethernet-based flow
        control mechanism for traffic sent from a router to a
        modem. Flow control is provided using one or more logical
        "Credit Windows", each of which will typically be supported by
        an associated virtual or physical queue.  A
        router will use traffic flow classification information provided
        by the modem to identify which traffic is associated with each
        credit window.
        Credit windows may be shared or dedicated on a per flow
        basis.
        See <xref target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-da-credit-extension" format="default"/> for a
        DiffServ-based version of credit window flow control.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document uses the traffic classification and credit window
        control mechanisms defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-traffic-classification" format="default"/> and <xref target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-credit-flow-control" format="default"/> to provide credit
        window based flow control based on DLEP destinations and
        Ethernet VLANs and Priority Code Points.  Ethernet Priority Code
        Point support is defined as part of the IEEE 802.1Q <xref target="IEEE.802.1Q_2014" format="default"/> tag format and includes a 3 bit
        "PCP" field.  The tag format also includes a 12 bit VLAN
        identifier (VID) field.  The defined mechanism allows for credit
        windows to be shared across traffic sent to multiple DLEP
        destinations, VLANs, and PCPs, or used exclusively for traffic
        sent to a particular destination and/or VLAN and/or PCP.  The
        extension also supports the "wildcard" matching of any PCP or
        VID.
      </t>
      <t>
        The extension defined in this document is referred to as "IEEE
        802.1Q Aware Credit Window" or, more simply, the "Ethernet
        Credit" extension. The reader should be familiar with both the
        traffic classification and credit window control mechanisms
        defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-traffic-classification" format="default"/> and <xref target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-credit-flow-control" format="default"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document defines a new DLEP Extension Type Value in <xref target="sec-ext-type" format="default"/> which is used to indicate support for
        the extension.

        the IEEE 802.1Q Aware Credit Window Extension is to be used, an

        Extensions Supported Data Item is sent and processed according
        to <xref target="RFC8175" format="default"/>.  Any implementation that indicates
        use of the IEEE 802.1Q Aware Credit Window Extension MUST
        support all Messages, Data Items, the Ethernet Traffic
        Classification Sub-Data Item, and all related processing defined

      <t>
        This section provides several network management guidelines to
        implementations supporting the IEEE 802.1Q Aware Credit Window
        Extension.
      </t>
      <t>
        The use of the extension defined in this document SHOULD be
        configurable on both modems and routers.
      </t>
      <t>
        Modems SHOULD support the configuration of PCP to credit window
        (queue) mapping.
      </t>
      <t>
        Modems MAY support the configuration of PCP to credit window
        (queue) mapping on a per VLAN basis. Note that VID value of zero
        (0) is used by <xref target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-traffic-classification" format="default"/> to indicate that
        VID is ignored and any VID value is used in traffic
        classification.
      </t>
      <t>
        When VLANs are supported by a modem without support from PCPs,
the modem SHOULD support the configuration of VLAN to credit window
        (queue) mapping.
      </t>
      <t>
        Modems MAY support the configuration of the number of credit
        windows (queues) to advertise to a router.
      </t>
      <t>
        Routers may have limits on the number of queues that they can
        support and, perhaps, even limits in supported credit window
        combinations, e.g., if per destination queues can even be
        supported at all.  When modem-provided credit window information
        exceeds the capabilities of a router, the router MAY use a
        subset of the provided credit windows.  Alternatively, a router
        MAY reset the session and indicate that the extension is not
        supported.  In either case, the mismatch of capabilities SHOULD
        be reported to the user via normal network management
        mechanisms, e.g., user interface or error logging.

        This document defines a DLEP extension that uses base DLEP
        mechanisms and the credit window control and flow mechanisms
        defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-traffic-classification" format="default"/> and <xref target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-credit-flow-control" format="default"/>.
        The use of those mechanisms, and the introduction of a new

        above those documented in <xref target="RFC8175" format="default"/>.  The
        approach taken to Security in that document applies equally to
        the mechanism defined in this document.

            <abstract>
              <t>When routing devices rely on modems to effect communications over wireless links, they need timely and accurate knowledge of the characteristics of the link (speed, state, etc.) in order to make routing decisions. In mobile or other environments where these characteristics change frequently, manual configurations or the inference of state through routing or transport protocols does not allow the router to make the best decisions. This document introduces a new protocol called the Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP), which provides a bidirectional, event-driven communication channel between the router and the modem to facilitate communication of changing link characteristics.</t>
